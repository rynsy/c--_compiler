USAGE:
  # Build both the compiler and pstack:
  make

  # Compile fib.cmm, producing fib.apm:
  ./compiler fib.cmm fib.apm

  # Disassemble fib.apm:
  ./pstack/apd fib
  # Execute fib.apm:
  ./pstack/api fib

BUILT-IN-FUNCTIONS:
  The cmm standard library contains three functions:

  exit()      : ends the program immediately
  puts("...") : prints a string (only literal strings are supported)
  putn(num)   : prints an integer (like printf("\t%d\n", num))

Note that function calls are not checked for number and type of
arguments: giving the wrong number is likely to smash the stack.
All functions return a value.

Functions with multiple arguments are not parsed correctly.
